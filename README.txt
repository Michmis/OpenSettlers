Introduction
------------

OpenSettlers is a web-based version of the board game Settlers of Catan.

This client-server system supports multiple simultaneous games between 
people and computer-controlled opponents. Initially created as an AI research project.

The client can be run by opening an html document. 

The server can either be run on the client (playing against bots only supported),
or run on any webserver supporting java.

OpenSettlers is an open-source project licensed under the GPL. The software is hosted at 

http://github.com/generateui/OpenSettlers.
